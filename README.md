# Robot-Operation-Algorithm
# Project Overview
This project presents a fully autonomous mobile robot designed to operate within a food warehouse environment. The robot is capable of receiving delivery tasks, navigating warehouse aisles, identifying and picking up boxes, and delivering them to designated areas – all without human intervention.

# Main Features
Battery-powered autonomous operation

Centralized task communication

Smart path planning with obstacle avoidance (A* + LIDAR)

Integrated robotic arm (forklift-style) for box handling

QR/ID-based box recognition

Auto-return to charging station when battery < 20%

Real-time status feedback to control system

# Execution Algorithm
Startup – Robot checks battery level and connects to the network

Receive Task – Gets box pickup and drop-off locations from control center

Path Planning – Calculates shortest safe path and avoids obstacles using sensors

Navigation – Moves through warehouse to target location

Box Detection – Scans and confirms box via QR or ID

Pick Up – Lifts box using robotic arm

Delivery – Navigates to delivery zone and unloads

Repeat / Recharge – Repeats process or returns to charging station
